Hi! I'm [Tejbir](http://about.me/tejbirwason). I'm a Junior Software Engineering student at UBC living in the beautiful city of Vancouver, Canada.

I like to dabble with rails web developement, social bots, operating system concepts, digital system design, and any new technology I can get my hands on. I am a former intern at Broadcom and Alcatel Lucent.

I claim to be a good [golfer](http://ubcgolf.wordpress.com/executives/) and [biker](http://www.strava.com/athletes/tejbirwason).

This is my blog populated with musings and fleeting thoughts.

Tweet at [@tejbirwason](http://twitter.com/tejbirwason), see some of my projects on [GitHub](http://github.com/tejbirwason), find my CV [here](http://raw.github.com/tejbirwason/tejbirwason.github.io/master/cv/TejbirWason_CV.pdf) or at [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tejbir-wason/30/840/b92). Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:tejbirwason@gmail.com?subject=Hello!). 

You have a nice day. â™¥
