Hi! I'm **[Tejbir Wason](http://about.me/tejbirwason)**. I'm a Junior Software Engineering student at UBC graduating in 2016 with co-op living in the beautiful city of Vancouver, Canada.

I'm a full-stack software developer who loves to read and write juicy code. I dabble with rails, web crawling, data mining, operating system concepts, digital system design, kinect motion and any quantified-self tech. 

I am a former intern at [Broadcom](http://www.broadcom.com) and a current summer intern at [Alcatel Lucent](http://www.alcatel-lucent.com).

I *claim* to be a good [golfer](http://ubcgolf.wordpress.com/executives/) and [biker](http://www.strava.com/athletes/tejbirwason).

This [blog]({{ site.url }}) is populated with musings and fleeting thoughts. [This]({{ site.url }}/hello-world) might be a good place to start.

You can find me on a variety of world wild interweb sites. Tweet at [@tejbirwason](http://twitter.com/tejbirwason), see some of my projects on [GitHub](http://github.com/tejbirwason), find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/cv/TejbirWason_CV.pdf) or visit my professional profile on  [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tejbirwason). I also spend an unhealthy amount of time on HackerNews where I am known as [twason](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tejbirwason).

Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:hello@tejbirwason.com). Or [pair with me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27d+love+to+pair+on+something+%40tejbirwason%21+%23pairwithme).

You have a nice day. â™¥
