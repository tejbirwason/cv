Hi! I'm **[Tejbir Wason](http://about.me/tejbirwason)**. I'm a Junior Software Engineering student at UBC graduating in 2016 with co-op living in the beautiful city of Vancouver, Canada.

I'm a full-stack software developer and content startegy specialist. I love to read and write juicy code. I dabble with rails, web crawlers, data mining, product design, backend scaling and any quantified-self tech. I share strategies telling a story in a noisy, social world through native micro-content. 

I have interned at [Broadcom](http://www.broadcom.com) and am a current summer intern at [Alcatel Lucent](http://www.alcatel-lucent.com). I founded [MyJam](http://myjam.co), winner of Startup Weekend Ottawa.

I *claim* to be a good [golfer](http://ubcgolf.wordpress.com/executives/) and [biker](http://www.strava.com/athletes/tejbirwason).

This [blog]({{ site.url }}) is populated with musings and fleeting thoughts. [This]({{ site.url }}/hello-world) might be a good place to start.

You can find me on a variety of world wild interweb sites. Tweet at [@tejbirwason](http://twitter.com/tejbirwason), see some of my projects on [GitHub](http://github.com/tejbirwason), my sandbox at [Capacious Labs](http://capacious.ca) or visit my professional profile on  [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tejbirwason). I also spend an unhealthy amount of time on HackerNews where I am known as [twason](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tejbirwason).

Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:tejbirwason@gmail.com). Or [pair with me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27d+love+to+pair+on+something+%40tejbirwason%21+%23pairwithme).

You have a nice day. â™¥
