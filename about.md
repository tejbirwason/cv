Hi! I'm **[Tejbir Wason](http://about.me/tejbirwason)**. I'm a Junior Software Engineering student at UBC living in the beautiful city of Vancouver, Canada.

I love to read and write juicy code. I dabble with rails web developement, social bots, web crawlers, operating system concepts, digital system design, kinect motion and any emerging quantified-self technology I can get my hands on. 

I am a former intern at [Broadcom](http://www.broadcom.com) and [Alcatel Lucent](http://www.alcatel-lucent.com).

I *claim* to be a good [golfer](http://ubcgolf.wordpress.com/executives/) and [biker](http://www.strava.com/athletes/tejbirwason).

This [blog]({{ site.url }}) is populated with some of my musings and fleeting thoughts.
