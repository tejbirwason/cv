Hi! I'm **[Tejbir Wason](http://about.me/tejbirwason)**. I'm a Junior Software Engineering student at UBC living in the beautiful city of Vancouver, Canada.

I love to read and write juicy code. I dabble with rails web developement, social bots, operating system concepts, digital system design, and any new technology I can get my hands on. I am a former intern at Broadcom and Alcatel Lucent.

I claim to be a good [golfer](http://ubcgolf.wordpress.com/executives/) and [biker](http://www.strava.com/athletes/tejbirwason).

This [blog]({{ site.url }}) is populated with some of my musings and fleeting thoughts.


You can find me on a variety of world wild interweb sites. Tweet at [@tejbirwason](http://twitter.com/tejbirwason), see some of my projects on [GitHub](http://github.com/tejbirwason), find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/cv/TejbirWason_CV.pdf) or visit my professional profile on  [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tejbir-wason/30/840/b92).

You have a nice day. â™¥
