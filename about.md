Hi! I'm **[Tejbir Wason](http://about.me/tejbirwason)**, call me Tj. I'm a Senior Software Engineering student at UBC graduating in 2016. I live in the beautiful city of Vancouver, Canada.

I'm a software engineer and product designer. I love to read and write juicy code. But code is just a means to an end. I build stuff that helps solve real pain points. I love operating in a competetive startup environment. I founded [MyJam](http://myjam.co), winner of Startup Weekend Ottawa. Currently brewing a couple more [ideas]({{ site.url }}/4s4m). I *claim* to be a good [golfer](http://www.tejbirwason.com/ubcgc/) and [biker](http://www.strava.com/athletes/tejbirwason). I silently aspire to become a professional golfer before turning 30.

I have worked as a software engineer at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) (Winter '15), [Alcatel Lucent](http://www.alcatel-lucent.com) (Summer '14) and [Broadcom](http://www.broadcom.com) (Summer'13, Fall'13).

This [blog]({{ site.url }}) is populated with some of my fleeting thoughts. [This]({{ site.url }}/hello-world) might be a good place to start reading.

You can find me on a variety of world wild interweb sites. Tweet at [@tejbirwason](http://twitter.com/tejbirwason), see some of my projects on [GitHub](http://github.com/tejbirwason), my sandbox at [Capacious Labs](http://capacious.ca) or visit my professional profile on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tejbirwason). Have a look at my [resume]({{ site.url }}/resume) for technical buzzwords that might get you to hire me. I spend an unhealthy amount of time on HackerNews where I am known as [twason](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tejbirwason).

Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:tejbirwason@gmail.com). Or [pair with me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27d+like+to+pair+on+something+%40tejbirwason%21+%23pairwithme).

You have a nice day. â™¥
