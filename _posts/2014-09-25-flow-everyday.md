I use a system rather than a goal (hat tip Scott Adams). A recent subtle addition to my daily process has lead to a disproportional increase in productivity. What’s even more important is that its lead to an exponential decay in anxiety. It is as simple as thinking like this: At the end of the day, if I have achieved some kind of flow, it has been a good day. Doesn't matter what I'm working on, doesn't matter if I am stuck, or even if I have moved backward. As long as I have hds the ability to distance myself from everything except the task at hand, it has been the most productive use of my time. 
I’ve tried to reverse engineer this zone of flow. I’ve deconstructed the build-up into two major aspects: set and setting. Getting one right and the other wrong won’t help. I need to get both of them exactly right. This takes a lot of experimenting. Uptil now, this is what I have learnt. My set (read mindset) needs to be upbeat and positive about the task at hand. This involves starting to think (ideally begin half an hour before I want to flow) about how having this task done would make me feel, and then working towards getting that feeling. The setting (read environment) needs to be quiet, with no (or very little) interruptions, light music, coffee and dim lights. 
I’ve tried flowing many times, but with an unflattering success rate (I'd say about 30%). Still searching for some intangible that I have not accounted in Maybe I'll strike a personal formula some day. Until then I can only focus on the set and the setting and hope to reach the zone. The zone where everything begins making sense, everything falls in place, a singular focus with some weird warping of time. 

Kill the noise, flow everyday.
