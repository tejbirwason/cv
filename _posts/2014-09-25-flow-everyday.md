I use a system rather than a goal (hat tip Scott Adams). A recent subtle addition to my daily process has lead to a disproportional increase in productivity. What’s even more important is that its lead to an exponential decay in anxiety. It is as simple as thinking like this: At the end of the day, if I have achieved some kind of flow, it has been a good day. Doesn't matter what I'm working on, doesn't matter if I am stuck, or even if I have moved backward. As long as I have hds the ability to distance myself from everything except the task at hand, it has been the most productive use of my time. 
I’ve tried to reverse engineer this feeling of flow. I’ve deconstructed the build-up into two major aspects: set and setting. Getting one right and the other wrong won’t help. You need to get both of them exactly right. Well at least I do. It might be different for different people. Either way, this takes a lot of experimenting. Uptil now, this is what I have learnt. My set (read mindset) needs to be upbeat and positive about the task at hand. This involves starting to think (ideally begin half an hour before I want to flow) about how having this task done would make me feel, and then working towards getting that feeling. The setting (read environment) needs to be quiet, with no (or very little) interruptions, light music, coffee and dim lights. 
To be honest, I’ve tried it many times but only . But that zone is profound. Everything begins making sense, everything falls in place, a singular focus with some weird warping of time. 

Kill the noise, flow everyday.
