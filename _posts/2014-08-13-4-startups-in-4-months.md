I like the idea of @levels.io's [12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/). Though I can't set aside a year for startups, I am aiming to kickstart 4 of my own ideas in the next 4 months. Some of the ideas have been brewing for a while, but  just haven't gotten around building. I go back to finish my third year of study at UBC, so I will manage a full course load while bootstrapping the startups on the side. This is an opportunity for me to establish that I am never too busy or "can't make time". No kmore excuses.

Just go fucking do it. It won't be easy, but this needs to be done, even if it's just a self-serving function to stretch my productivity. 

Right now I have a clear vision for at least two ideas, which is a good place to start. There will most definitely be pivots and improvisation on the way. Time to just fucking launch and not get caught in analysis paralysis.
