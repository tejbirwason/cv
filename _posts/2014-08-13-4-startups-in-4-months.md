I like the idea of @levels.io's [12 Startups in 12 Months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/). Though I can't set aside a year, I am aiming to kickstart 4 of my own ideas in the next 4 months. Some of the ideas have been brewing for a while, but  just haven't gotten around building. I go back to finish my third year of study at UBC, so I will manage a full course load while bootstrapping the startups on the side. This is an opportunity to establish myself as never too busy and stop making "don't have enough time" excuses.

It won't be easy, but this needs to be done, even if it's just a self-serving function to stretch my productivity. 

Right now I have a clear vision for at least two ideas, which is a good place to start. There will definitely be pivots and a lot of improvisation on the way. Time to stop the analysis paralysis and just go fucking launch each month.
