Summer is just right the corner and it can’t come here quicker. One for the reason that finals season inhibits progress on any of my side-projects, and also because I am looking forward to interning at Alcatel Lucent this summer. This internship is an opportunity to work in a different industry (I previously interned at Broadcom) and also explore a new city. Looking forward to four months of sultry summer in Ottawa, Canada’s capital city. 


I have endeavoured not to plan too much for this summer as past is proof that most plans don’t materialize as I pick things on the fly. So contrary to what I have consistently done over past summers, let this be a freewheeling. Looking forward to the experience of living alone for the first time and exploring a new city. If there is anything I want to promise myself, it is to put myself out there and meet new people both at work and off. Staying on campus at the University of Ottawa will be a good opportunity to meet folks my age. I am also keenly looking forward to attending developer meetups to meet like minded people in the active Ottawa tech sector. 


Clearly four months is too short a time as an intern to make any substantial lasting impact at a company as large as Alcatel. This is liberating so that I can treat this opportunity similar to a date with a startup to gauge if I fit the culture at Alcatel. Either way I expect to gain a clearer perspective of the larger forces controlling and distributing internet with all its possibilities.


Hoping to forge healthy new professional and personal relationships in the next four months. Time to bring on solo living, bring on Ottawa.
