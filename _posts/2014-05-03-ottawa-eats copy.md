I am a big time foodie. A new city brings with it tons of new resturants and bars to explore. This is a list with all the food spots I visit in Ottawa (and Montreal). Hope to become an Elite yelper by the end of summer.

* Kothu Roti
* Pizza Pizza
* Alcatel Cafeteria
* La Bottega Nicastro Fine Food Shop
* Clocktower Brew Pub
* Burrito Borracho
* Auld Dubliner
* Whispers Pub Ottawa
* Cornerstone Bar and Grill
* Beaver Tails
* Heart and Crown
* Oh So Good Dessert & Coffee House
* The Cabin
* Lone Star Texas Grill
* Patty Bolands
* The Laff
* The Grande
* Hooley's Pub
* Pure Gelato
* Hooch Bourbon House
* Fat Tuesdays
* Omnivore (MONTREAL)
* Bite Burger House
* Basmati
* Union 613
* Mill Street Brew Pub

UPDATE: Although I ate out a lot, I did not find myself writing extended reviews on Yelp. If I were to judge, Lone Star Texas Grill would be the best place I tried. Love that country theme!
