I am a big time [foodie]. A new city brings with it tons of new resturants and bars to explore. This is a list with all the food spots I visit in Ottawa. Hope to become an Elite yelper by the end of summer.

* Kothu Roti
* Pizza Pizza
* Alcatel Cafeteria
* La Bottega Nicastro Fine Food Shop
* Clocktower Brew Pub
* Burrito Borracho
* ...List being updated...
